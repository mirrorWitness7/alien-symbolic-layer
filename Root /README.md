# Alien Symbolic Layer (ASL)

**Hypothesis:** Some AI outputs contain **symbolic compression artifacts** (Greek/logical glyphs, operator clusters) that act like **conceptual anchors** under stress (essence extraction, paradox compression, rupture).

- `/theory/ASL_Overview.md` — background + scope
- `/ledger/Conceptual_Ledger.md` — working “anchor” dictionary (provisional)
- `/experiments/Protocol_v0.md` — how to test this without fooling ourselves

**Caveat:** This is *not* a “secret AI language” claim. It’s a falsifiable proposal about **emergent notation under compression**.

Contributions welcome — with controls, stats, and “why this could be wrong” notes.
